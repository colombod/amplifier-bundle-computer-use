"""Backend selection: probe candidates in order, use the first one that works.

D1 fix lives here. `mount()` must never register a tool that cannot possibly work on
this machine - this module is where that decision gets made, once, before any tool is
mounted. Every candidate backend gets a cheap `probe()` (see `backend.Backend.probe`);
the first one that reports itself available is returned. If none can serve this
machine, `select_backend` raises `NoBackendAvailable` with every attempt's reason, and
`mount()` is expected to catch it, log it clearly, and mount nothing.

#: The shape fact about how a target machine is selected - the one thing a
#: model resolving "is remote possible?" from schema silence cannot see on its
#: own. Shared VERBATIM by two audiences so the fact never drifts between them:
#: `_REMEDIATION` below (the failure path - an operator reads this only when
#: mount() could not find a working backend) and `DesktopTool.description`
#: (`__init__.py` - the success path, read by the model on every mounted
#: session). Deliberately a shape claim, not an existence claim: asserting
#: "remote is possible" contradicts a schema that shows no host parameter, and
#: a model reconciling prose against schema trusts the schema. Explaining WHY
#: the schema is silent - the target is resolved once, at mount, not per call -
#: is the fact that actually closes the gap.
_TARGET_MODEL = (
    "set config.target='ssh://user@host' to point this capability at a "
    "different, reachable machine instead. The target is bound ONCE, at "
    "mount time - there is deliberately no per-call host parameter, and its "
    "absence is not evidence this capability is local-only. Driving a "
    "different machine means restarting with a new config.target, not a new "
    "argument to an existing call."
)

#: Appended to `NoBackendAvailable`'s message - the "what to do next" a bare
#: exception type name and a per-backend reason string do not supply on their
#: own. `mount()` (`tool-computer-use/__init__.py`) logs this whole message via
#: `logger.warning` and echoes it into the mounted-module manifest's
#: `description` field, so this text - not a traceback - is what an operator
#: actually sees when computer-use silently isn't there. Deliberately generic
#: (not per-backend) because `attempts` already carries the specific reason for
#: each candidate that was actually tried; this is the part that reason text
#: cannot supply on its own - the remediation options that apply regardless of
#: which specific backend failed and why.
