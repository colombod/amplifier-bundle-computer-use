"""Per-target singleton `SshTransport` sharing: at most ONE remote agent process
per (ssh_path, host) target, shared by every consumer in this process.

Root cause this fixes (isolated and reproduced 2026-08-01, not re-investigated
here): two concurrent SSH-deployed agent processes against the same macOS
target corrupt each other's Screen Recording TCC grant. `CGDisplayCreateImage`
then returns `None` for BOTH agents - including the one that was capturing
successfully a moment earlier - and macOS raises no exception, just hands back
nothing (see `macos.py::capture`). This bites through Amplifier specifically
because more than one consumer in a single process can end up calling
`registry.select_backend()` for the SAME remote target: the parent session's
own `computer`/`desktop` tools (if configured) and a delegated
`computer-operator` child-session's `mount()` each used to build their OWN
`SshTransport` - two agent processes, one target, one poisoned grant.

Design
------
A module-level registry maps a target key -> one `_SharedEntry`, which owns
exactly one real `SshTransport` and a refcount. `acquire_shared_transport()`
returns a `SharedTransportHandle` that duck-types `SshTransport`'s
`connect()`/`send()`/`close()` (and exposes `.handshake`), so `RemoteBackend`
needs NO changes - it already only calls those three methods on whatever
object `registry._build_ssh_transport()` hands it.

Sharing contract
----------------
- The FIRST `connect()` for a target actually deploys the payload and runs the
  handshake; every later `connect()` for the SAME target (from a different
  handle) reuses the cached handshake and just re-validates the CALLING
  consumer's own `required_permissions` against it - no second deploy, no
  second agent process.
- `close()` decrements the entry's refcount; the underlying `SshTransport` is
  only actually torn down (SSH subprocess killed, `release_all`/`bye` sent)
  when the LAST handle releases it. An earlier `close()` never kills a
  transport another handle is still using.
- If the shared transport is ever detected as dead (a `send()`/`connect()`
  raises `SshConnectError` - lost connection, crashed agent, etc.), the entry
  is marked broken and evicted from the registry immediately, under the same
  lock that guards refcounting - no window where a broken entry can still be
  handed out to a new `acquire_shared_transport()` call. Any handle that is
  STILL holding a reference to that now-broken entry fails loud and
  immediately on its next `connect()`/`send()` call, naming the retirement
  explicitly, rather than transparently reconnecting mid-operation - a silent
  reconnect would spin up a brand-new agent process (and therefore a brand-new,
  empty `HeldInputLedger`) out from under whichever OTHER handle still
  believes inputs are held on the old one. The next genuinely new
  `acquire_shared_transport()` call for that target (e.g. the next session
  that mounts this tool) builds a fresh entry and goes through a real
  connect+deploy+handshake again.

Thread safety
-------------
`ComputerTool.execute()` dispatches through `asyncio.to_thread`, so concurrent
callers sharing one handle are real, not hypothetical. `SshTransport.send()`
already serializes request/response pairs with its own internal lock (see
`ssh_transport.py`); this module only needs to protect its OWN state
(refcount, `broken`, the registry dict, and "has anyone connected yet"), which
`_registry_lock` and each entry's `_connect_lock` do.
