"""The provider wire dialects this tool speaks.

Two vendors ship a native `computer` tool, and they disagree about almost
everything on the wire. Both were driven against the same real desktop, through
this tool, before this module existed - the differences below are transcribed
from that traffic (`tests/fixtures/captures/`), not designed ahead of it:

===================  ====================================  =========================

Why a table of records and not a framework
-------------------------------------------
N is two. A `Protocol` with two implementors, a registry with registration
hooks, or a plugin-discovery mechanism would all be scaffolding erected around
a dict lookup. What is actually needed is: *given a tool type, how do I
declare it; given a tool-call payload, how do I read it.* That is a dispatch
table. `Dialect` is a frozen record holding the four facts that genuinely
differ, and `DIALECTS` is the table. Adding a vendor is one more record and one
more row - no new machinery, and nothing to edit in `__init__.py` or
`tool_versions.py`.

What deliberately did NOT become per-dialect
---------------------------------------------
Everything downstream of `read_actions()`. Both dialects normalize into this
tool's own `(action, params)` vocabulary and then run through the *same*
`ComputerTool._run()`, the same `ACTIONS` membership check, the same
`read_only`/`MUTATING` gate, and the same halt/error handling. Those were never
provider-specific; only the wire form on either side of them is. A second,
parallel action dispatcher per vendor is exactly what this table exists to
prevent.

Where the *rest* of the provider story still lives, and why it is not here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
`hook-computer-use` probes whether the mounted provider will actually carry a
native tool type to the wire. That knowledge is NOT in this module and cannot
be: the probes drive amplifier *provider module* internals
(`_derive_native_tool_betas`, `_convert_tools_from_request`) - plumbing names,
not vendor wire format - and `hook-computer-use` declares no dependency on this
package (see its `pyproject.toml`: ``dependencies = []``), so it cannot import
this table. Those are two different axes that happen to correlate 1:1 while
there are exactly two vendors.

# DELIBERATELY ABSENT FROM `DIALECTS`. This record is a measuring instrument for
# the claim in `docs/designs/multi-provider-design.md` Sec 18 ("adding provider
# N+1 is bounded work"), not a provider this bundle supports. Qwen was dropped
# in Phase 0 BEFORE this module existed (`tests/fixtures/captures/qwen-verdict.md`),
# so its shape informed nothing here - which is exactly what makes it a valid
# out-of-sample test and what Sec 18 says the Gemini measurement lacked.
#
# Keeping it out of `DIALECTS` keeps real dispatch, `model_tool_types()` and
# `beta_headers()` bit-identical. `tests/test_qwen_out_of_sample.py` monkeypatches
# it in, exactly as the existing synthetic-dialect tests already do.

    The three candidate return values and why each is forbidden:

      * `{}` - emits an empty, malformed entry in `tools[]`. Silent degradation.
