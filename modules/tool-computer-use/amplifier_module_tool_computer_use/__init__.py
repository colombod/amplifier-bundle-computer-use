"""Amplifier tool module: `computer` - Anthropic native computer-use, on whichever
desktop this machine can actually reach.

The tool mounts under the name `computer` so the orchestrator can execute the
`tool_use` blocks Claude emits for its built-in computer tool. `hook-computer-use`
promotes this tool's declaration to the *native* Anthropic tool type on the wire and
turns screenshot markers into real image content blocks.

Without the hook the tool still works as an ordinary function tool (Claude drives it
from the JSON schema below), it just cannot show Claude the screen.

Platform backend
-----------------
This module no longer assumes Windows. `mount()` probes every configured backend
(`registry.select_backend`) *before* registering any tool - D1: if nothing can serve
this machine, `computer`/`desktop` are not mounted at all, and the reason is logged
plainly. See `backend.py` for the protocol and why it is shaped the way it is.

Display geometry is resolved once, right after a backend is selected, and cached for
the life of the tool (D2): `native_tool_spec` used to call a bridge property that
shelled out to PowerShell with a 30s timeout on *every* provider request. It now
reads a plain in-memory value and can never block.

        Single shared implementation for both `resolve_display()` (mount time and

        switch) - one place computes monitor-scoped geometry, so there is no
        separate "switch monitor" code path that could drift out of sync with how
        mount-time resolution works.

        `allow_fallback` governs exactly one failure mode: monitor enumeration
        being genuinely unavailable (`Backend.list_monitors()` raising
        `BackendError` - no RandR, no RandR Monitor objects, etc.). Verified for
        real on a headless/virtual single-display X11 session during
        development (RandR present, `GetMonitors` returns zero - a real,
        legitimate configuration, not a hypothetical): that machine has exactly
        one display, so falling back to `screen_geometry()`'s virtual-desktop
        bounding box - the code path that has ALWAYS been correct for a single
        display - reports the SAME rectangle enumeration would have, had it
        worked. That is not "pretending there is one monitor" (no `MonitorInfo`
        is invented); it is correctly falling back to the one mode that was
        already right for this machine, loudly logged so it stays diagnosable.
        This is why `allow_fallback` is only ever `True` when `target` is the
        unconfigured default (`resolve_display()` with no explicit
        `target_monitor` config) - an explicit ask (`target_monitor` config, or
        a runtime `select_monitor()` call) always fails loud instead, and a
        target id that IS enumerated but does not match a request always fails
        loud regardless of `allow_fallback` (see `select_monitor()` call below):

        D2 fix: this used to call `self._bridge.display()`, a property that shelled
        out to PowerShell with a 30s timeout on *every single* provider request. That
        subprocess call is why the hook's `hasattr` guard (D3) mattered so much: any
        transient bridge failure here raised on the hot path. Display is now resolved
        once at mount and cached in-memory; this property does no I/O and cannot
        raise for that reason again.

        Per-monitor targeting tension: `desktop.select_monitor` can change what
        `self.display` reports *mid-session*, and this property's declared
        `display_width_px`/`display_height_px` must never drift out of sync with
        what `computer.screenshot` is actually capturing. That is why this stays a
        plain property reading `self.display` rather than something cached at
        construction: the orchestrator's `ToolSpec` construction (see
        `amplifier-module-loop-streaming`'s `_build_tool_spec`, which reads this
        property fresh to build every request's tool list - it is never cached
        there either; only D2's *I/O* was cached here, not the *value*) re-reads
        `native_tool_spec` on every `provider:request`, so the very next request
        after a monitor switch automatically declares the new dimensions. The
        in-memory state this property reads (`self._display`) is exactly what
        `select_monitor` updates - one piece of state, two readers (this property
        and `_run`), always in sync.

        is read earlier in the same turn, by the orchestrator's own `ToolSpec`

        correction inside `complete()` lands one turn ahead of the read it

        correct it in time - the correction has to already be in place before

        THIS session's first real action, and never before.

        Why not `mount()` (the defect this closes): `amplifier_core`'s loader
        calls every tool module's `mount()` TWICE per real session - once as a
        throwaway protocol-compliance probe
        (`amplifier_core.validation.tool.ToolValidator._check_protocol_compliance`,
        against a fresh `MockCoordinator` whose `mount()` result is discarded
        and torn down in a `finally` block a few lines later - see that
        module's source), and once for real
        (`loader.mount_with_config_ep`/`mount_with_config_direct_ep`). Both
        calls run the module's real `mount()` function with the real config.
        Building the disclosure inside `mount()` meant the FIRST dialog a
        human ever answered could be for the discarded probe - and any
        consent given applied to a `ComputerTool`/`CoexistenceGuard` pair
        about to be thrown away, not the one actually about to drive
        anything. Gating here instead means a validation probe - which never
        calls `execute()` on the tool it mounted, only `mount()` itself -
        cannot trigger this at all: there is no code path from
        `_check_protocol_compliance` to this method.

        What counts as "first use": ANY action on `computer` or `desktop`,
        not just a mutating one. Both classes' `execute()` call this before
        doing anything else (`ComputerTool.execute` directly;
        `DesktopTool.execute` via `self._computer._ensure_announced()`), so a
        pure read - `screenshot`, `zoom`, `list_windows`, `get_clipboard` - is
        gated identically to a click or a keystroke. A screenshot IS a
        capture of a human's screen; gating only writes would let an agent
        silently see everything on the target's display before ever
        disclosing that it was watching, which defeats the entire purpose of
        a session-start disclosure. There is exactly one gate, not one gate
        for writes and a silent hole for reads.

        Ordering: because this runs synchronously (via `asyncio.to_thread`,
        same as `_run` itself) as the very first statement of `execute()`,
        the announcement fully COMPLETES - dialog answered, overlay actually
        shown, or the channel's own failure policy resolved - before any
        backend call for that action begins. Not concurrent with the first
        action, not merely started before it: this call returns (or raises)
        before `execute()`'s own dispatch logic ever runs.

        Concurrency: idempotent and thread-safe. Two actions issued by the
        model in the same turn can race to be "first" on two different
        worker threads. `self._announce_lock` is a per-instance lock
        (distinct from the module-level `_announcement_lock`, which guards
        the cross-instance/cross-process channel cache in
        `_build_announcement`) - double-checked so the actual
        dialog/overlay/RPC call, which can genuinely block (a countdown
        timer, an SSH round trip), only ever runs once per instance; every
        other caller either returns immediately (already announced) or
        blocks briefly on the lock and then reuses whatever the winner
        decided.

        Refusal is STICKY for the life of this instance (this mount, this
        session): once `self._announce_refused` is set, every later call -
        from this thread or any other, for `computer` OR `desktop` -
        re-raises the SAME `AnnouncementRefused` immediately, without
        touching the backend again. Combined with there being exactly one
        gate both tools' `execute()` methods call, this makes "refused" mean
        "stop driving" structurally, not by convention: no action from
        either tool can reach the backend without passing through here
        first, and once refused this method never again returns normally.

        The two live wire forms disagree about shape and cardinality -
        Anthropic sends one `{"action": ..., "coordinate": [...]}` per call;
        OpenAI batches N `{"type": ..., "x": ..., ...}` entries under `actions`
        and expects ONE result for the whole batch (`providers.py` has the full
        comparison). `providers.read_call` is the only place that knows the
        difference: it identifies the dialect from the payload's actual shape -
        never by asking which provider is mounted - and yields this tool's own
        `(action, params)` vocabulary. Everything after that line is shared, and
        was already shared before this seam existed: one `ACTIONS` check, one
        `read_only`/`MUTATING` gate, one `_run()`, one set of error handlers.
        There is no second, parallel dispatcher per vendor and there must never
        be one.

        Cardinality is not special-cased either: a single Anthropic action is a
        one-element batch, and the loop below is identical for both. The one
        genuine per-dialect difference is what a result must carry -
        `result_must_carry_screenshot`.

        anything else - is `_ensure_announced()` (see that method): the

    """Build the `CoexistenceGuard` for `backend`, or `None` if this backend
    has no proven presence-detector wiring yet (`docs/designs/coexistence.md`).

    Deliberately conservative: a guard is only ever constructed for a backend
    that exposes `presence_idle_ms()` (today: `LinuxX11Backend`, `MacOSBackend`
    since `presence.GUARD_MS["macos"]` was measured by O4, `WindowsBackend`
    (via `bridge.ps1`'s `presence_idle` action), and `RemoteBackend` (forwards
    the read to the SAME method on the target's own backend, \u00a75 of
    `docs/designs/remote-transport.md`) - see each method's docstring). A
    backend with no such method gets no coexistence layer at all, rather than
    one built on a guessed/unmeasured `GUARD` band - the same "do not claim a
    guarantee you do not have" principle \u00a75.5 applies to Windows `type_text`.

    `cfg["coexistence"]` (all keys optional):
      - `enabled`: **no longer controls whether this guard is built.**
        Defect fix (see `docs/designs/coexistence.md` \u00a76.0/C1 item 6): this
        key used to make `enabled: False` return `None` here, which silently
        removed the halt invariant, pause, target binding, and geometric
        exclusion in one boolean, at `logger.info`, with no consumer
        anywhere ever noticing. That directly contradicted \u00a76.0 ("no
        configuration key disables [the halt]") and made C1's acceptance
        item 6 false. Whenever a backend structurally supports presence
        detection (the two checks below), this guard is now built
        unconditionally - no config key of any kind can prevent that.
        `enabled` is not deleted: it keeps a real, narrower effect - see
        `_disclosure_decline_reason` - as an alias of `announce` for
        declining session-start *disclosure only*, gated by a mount-time
        presence check (`_refuse_if_disclosure_declined_with_human_present`).
      - `drive_anyway` (default `False`, \u00a77.6/D5): permits *beginning* to
        drive when a human is already detected present at guard-construction
        time. Logged when it fires. Never affects the halt invariant.

    Defect 2 fix: D1's refusal to mount `computer`/`desktop` for a backend that
    cannot serve them is correct and is NOT changed by this class - what was
    wrong is what happened *after* that refusal. Previously `mount()` returned
    a manifest with `provides: []` and logged a line nobody was watching; the
    session then continued with computer-use simply absent - no tool, no
    error, no trace in the model's own context. A live session hit exactly
    this: the model, given no `computer`/`desktop` tool and no indication one
    was ever supposed to exist, silently improvised its own `ssh`+`screencapture`
    workaround instead of telling the user computer-use was unavailable.

    This tool is NOT a degraded form of `computer`/`desktop` - it never
    attempts to serve a single real action, so it does not weaken D1's "do not
    pretend to work" invariant. It exists purely to make the refusal visible in
    the one place a silently-omitted tool cannot be: the tool declarations
    sent with *every* provider request, whether or not the model ever calls
    it. Its `execute()` is a fallback for the (unlikely, since its own
    description says not to) case the model calls it anyway - still an honest,
    immediate failure, never a hang or a fabricated result.

    Deliberately a distinct name (`computer_use_unavailable`), not `computer`/
    `desktop`: those names are reserved for a tool that can actually act
    (`ComputerTool`/`DesktopTool`) - reusing them here for a stub would blur
    "the tool exists but is broken" with "the tool never existed" in the
