"""Local Linux desktop backend, via X11 (Xlib + XTEST).

In-process: every action below talks straight to the X server over a persistent
Xlib connection - no subprocess anywhere on the hot path. This is the opposite
constraint from `WindowsBackend`, which must cross the WSL2/Win32 boundary through
`powershell.exe` for every single action. That asymmetry is exactly what forced the
`Backend` protocol (see `backend.py`) to be shaped around *capabilities*, not around
either implementation's plumbing.

Screen capture uses `Display.get_image()` (an in-process X `GetImage` request)
rather than shelling out to ImageMagick's `import` - see `capture()`.

Clipboard is the one place this backend shells out (to `xclip`): implementing the
ICCCM/ CLIPBOARD selection-owner protocol correctly (answering `SelectionRequest`
from other clients, persisting after this process exits) is a well-solved problem
`xclip` already gets right; reimplementing it in-process would trade a battle-tested
dependency for a large amount of fragile protocol code with no capability upside.
Its absence is a normal, loud `BackendError` on the specific clipboard action, not a
capability the whole backend probe depends on (the `computer` tool works fine
without it; only `desktop.get_clipboard`/`set_clipboard` need it).

    This is the ground truth `probe()` checks a blind

    `_display_explicit`). A real, healthy, XTEST-capable X server can still
    be the WRONG one: a stray `Xvfb` left running from an earlier
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` ship-gate session, with `DISPLAY` still exported in a
    shell nobody closed, satisfies every other check in this file
    identically to the user's real interactive desktop - and was observed
    doing exactly that (alive 6+ days, `ppid=1`) on a real machine. Capture,
    click, and type all "succeed" against the wrong display with zero
    errors, which is exactly the reported symptom: "it says it did it, no
    errors, but nothing happens on my desktop."

    An **active-monitor-count (RandR) check was tried and rejected**: a
    real, logged-in-but-headless desktop can legitimately report zero active
    monitors while a stray `Xvfb` reports one active (fake) monitor - RandR
    gets exactly backwards which one is "the user's session" on such a box.
    `systemctl --user show-environment` does not have that failure mode: it
    reports what the LOGIN session itself registered, not what any given X
    server's virtual output happens to claim.

    Returns `None` - "no reference available", not "mismatch" - whenever
    there is nothing to compare against: no systemd user manager reachable
    at all (`systemctl` missing, no per-user D-Bus session - a container or
    a bare CI box with no systemd `--user` instance), or a reachable one

    no GUI login ever). Both are the honest, legitimate no-user-session case
