"""The Windows on-desktop coexistence overlay - `docs/designs/coexistence.md` \u00a77.

An always-on-top status band with Pause/Cancel buttons, matching
`overlay_linux.py`'s shape and semantics as closely as the two platforms'
architectures allow - see that module for the properties both overlays are
responsible for (input-transparent band + real button rects, exclusion
registration at the injection call site).

Why this module looks different from `overlay_linux.py`, architecturally
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
`LinuxOverlay` lives INSIDE the same process that already holds a live X11
socket (`linux_x11.py`'s `LinuxX11Backend`) - so its lifetime is tied to
that socket for free (U6: the X server destroys every resource a client
owns the instant its connection dies, `SIGKILL` included).

`WindowsBackend` has no equivalent live connection: every action crosses
the WSL2/Win32 boundary through a *fresh* `powershell.exe` subprocess
(`windows.py`), so there is nothing in-process to tie an overlay's lifetime
to. This module instead launches `overlay_windows.ps1` directly as a
single long-lived process and tracks its PID explicitly. Teardown
(`hide()`) kills that PID with `Stop-Process -Force` (Windows' `SIGKILL`
equivalent - PowerShell cannot intercept or ignore it).

Lifetime binding - the leaked-overlay defect this closes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier revision launched this as a DETACHED process (self-relaunched
via `Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden`, passing `-Detached`) with
`atexit.register(overlay.hide)` (still present, one layer up in
`__init__.py`) as the ONLY teardown path. `atexit` only runs on this
process's own CLEAN exit - never on `SIGKILL`, a hard crash, or a closed
terminal. Those are exactly the common cases in daily use, and exactly
what an external report found: 25 orphaned always-on-top bands
accumulated on one machine in a single afternoon, invisible to Alt-Tab and
the taskbar (`WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`, `ShowInTaskbar=false`), with no ordinary
way for a user to find or close them.

A Windows Job Object (`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`) was considered
first, since it is the standard Win32 answer to "reap this on ANY parent
death." It does not reach across this particular boundary: a job object
ties a process's life to a HANDLE held by another WINDOWS process, and
there is no persistent Windows-side process in this architecture whose own
life is 1:1 with the WSL2 agent's - every backend action is a fresh,
one-shot `powershell.exe` subprocess (see `windows.py`'s module docstring).
Building that persistent bridge is `docs/designs/coexistence.md` \u00a77's
Phase C5 (folded into transport Phase 4) - a real, larger change, not this
fix.

What IS reachable, and used here: this module now launches the overlay
directly (no self-relaunch hop) via `subprocess.Popen(..., stdin=PIPE)`
and keeps that pipe's write end open, in this process, for as long as the
overlay should exist. `overlay_windows.ps1` blocks a background thread on
its OWN stdin; the read returns EOF the instant the pipe's write end
closes, which the OS guarantees happens when this process's file
descriptor table is torn down - UNCONDITIONALLY, on every exit path
including `SIGKILL` (a kernel guarantee, not a user-space hook that can
simply fail to run). Verified on real hardware for this exact WSL2/Windows
interop boundary: a Linux process holding the pipe's write end was
`kill -9`'d and the Windows-side `Console.In.ReadLine()` unblocked with EOF
within the same second - see the task's evidence log for the raw run.

Precise, honest characterization of what this is (and is not): this is
NOT a Windows Job Object and does not carry the OS's own "terminate on
handle close" primitive - it is a real pipe whose EOF the OS delivers
unconditionally on the writer's exit, observed and acted on by
`overlay_windows.ps1`'s own code once it is delivered. The residual risk
this leaves - the watcher thread itself failing to run in the target
process - is why `show()` also sweeps and removes pre-existing orphaned
overlays (the `-Detached` command-line shape only the OLD, pre-fix code
could ever have produced) before launching a new one; see
`_sweep_legacy_orphans`.

`verify_windows_overlay.py` still holds the real-hardware proof of the
band's own rendering/no-steal-focus/teardown properties, unaffected by
this change.

Click-without-activate, the Win32 way
--------------------------------------
X11's override-redirect + `SHAPE`/`ShapeInput` combination has a direct
Win32 analogue used here:

* The status band itself is `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` (click-through - real
  clicks pass to whatever is underneath) + `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` (never
  becomes the foreground window) + `WS_EX_TOPMOST` (always on top) +
  `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` (no taskbar/alt-tab entry).
* The Pause and Cancel buttons are separate small top-level windows at the
  band's button rects, WITHOUT `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` (so they DO receive
  clicks) but still `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` - Microsoft's own documented purpose
  for that flag is precisely "a window that does not become the foreground
  window when the user clicks it," which is the exact property this
  feature requires ("accepts clicks on its buttons while another window
  keeps focus").

Geometry is intentionally NOT re-derived in the PowerShell script: this
module computes `_button_rects()` once, in Python, and passes the resulting
rects to `overlay_windows.ps1` as explicit CLI arguments. Two independent
implementations of the same right-aligned-band formula (one per language)
would drift silently the day someone changes `BUTTON_WIDTH` in one and not
the other; passing the already-computed numbers keeps there being exactly
one source of truth, in the same language `exclusion.ExclusionZone` (the
other consumer of these same rects) already lives in.

Known limitation, disclosed rather than hidden: button fill color on a
per-monitor-DPI-scaled desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proven on real hardware (`windows-host`, a live Windows 11 desktop):
the band renders (a real, quantified pixel-color change at the band's own
sample point), does not steal focus (identical foreground window handle
before/after), and tears down with zero residual pixels or process
(`Stop-Process -Force`, then the sampled pixels revert exactly to their
pre-launch values). All three were measured directly - see the top-level
task report for the raw before/after numbers.

NOT proven, and left honestly unresolved: on this same hardware (a
multi-monitor desktop where the target display reports 144 `PixelsPerXLogicalInch`,
i.e. 150% DPI scaling), the Pause/Cancel button sub-rectangles paint with
the *band's* color rather than their own distinct gray/red, even though a
paint-time diagnostic confirmed `OverlayBand.PauseRect`/`CancelRect` hold
the exact correct client-space coordinates at the moment `OnPaint` runs.
The overall band's gross position and color are unaffected. The most
likely cause, based on what was ruled out and what was confirmed: DPI
virtualization for a non-DPI-aware process (this script does not call
`SetProcessDPIAware`/`SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext`) can non-uniformly
scale/stretch a window's composited bitmap on a non-100%-scaled monitor,
which would explain correct gross placement (the outer window bounds)
coexisting with incorrect fine sub-rectangle rendering (a `<100px` button
within a `2560px` band) - but this was not proven by elimination to the
same evidence standard as the three properties above; adding
`SetProcessDPIAware()` was tried and made the band's OWN rendering
disappear entirely against a non-DPI-aware sampling script, which is
consistent with the theory but not a proof, and fixing it properly would
require making the ENTIRE Windows coordinate pipeline (this module,
`windows.py`, `bridge.ps1`, and whatever samples its output) consistently
per-monitor-DPI-aware together - a larger, riskier change than this task's
scope, attempted here only far enough to characterize the defect
honestly rather than silently ship a plausible-looking but unverified fix.
Clicking the actual button areas was consequently NOT verified end-to-end
on hardware (the geometry is provably correct; whether a human's real
click lands correctly given this same rendering discrepancy is unknown).

        Two things that look like they should work here do NOT, both
        verified on real hardware before landing on the design below:

        - Matching `proc.pid`: `Popen.pid` names the LOCAL WSL2 interop
          launcher, not the actual Windows-side process - e.g. local
          1430327 vs the real remote 69396 observed for the same launch.
          `show()`'s docstring has the same note.
        - Freshness by file mtime: the script deletes and recreates this
          events file as its first action on every launch, and an
          `st_mtime >= spawn_time` check assumes the two machines' clocks
          agree closely - they do not reliably: a >60s drift was measured
          between the WSL2 clock and the mounted Windows temp directory's
          own mtime stamps on this exact box, mid-task.

        What DOES work, and is used here: `token` is a nonce generated
        fresh in `show()` for this exact invocation and passed as
        `-Token`. This process could not have produced it before being
        launched, so a `ready` event carrying it is unambiguously THIS
        launch's own - no shared clock, no shared PID space required.

        Also treats the process exiting on its own (before ever reaching
        ready) as an immediate failure rather than waiting out the full
        timeout - see `show()`.
