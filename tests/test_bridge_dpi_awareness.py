"""Regression guard for the multi-monitor DPI-virtualization defect in
`bridge.ps1`.

CI-side only: no Windows target, no PowerShell, no subprocess spawned - this
is a source-text assertion, following the same established pattern as
`test_overlay_windows.py` for Windows-only code this suite cannot execute.
Real-hardware proof lives in the accompanying investigation report (a real
four-monitor Win11 desktop reached over SSH, `a-user@example-desktop`), not
here - matching `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "ship gate" precedent for platform code
with no CI-side Windows box available.

Bug this guards against
------------------------
`bridge.ps1` used to call the legacy `SetProcessDPIAware()`, which declares
only SYSTEM DPI awareness. Measured live on a real four-monitor 4K desktop
(every physical panel 3840x2160 at 150% scaling): under that legacy
awareness level, `[System.Windows.Forms.Screen]::AllScreens` reports every
monitor's bounds DPI-VIRTUALIZED to 2560x1440 - not the true physical pixel
grid. Every downstream coordinate (`Save-Screenshot`'s `CopyFromScreen`,
`SetCursorPos`, `GetWindowRect`, ...) is built from those same virtualized
bounds, so a monitor-scoped `screenshot` captures a squished/cropped
fraction of the real monitor into a bitmap sized for the WRONG dimensions,
and every click/move computed from that same `Display` lands off-target on
that monitor - precisely the live-agent report this fix responds to
("DISPLAY2's 3840x2160 renders into only the left ~635px of the 1280x720
frame").

The fix declares Per-Monitor-v2 DPI awareness
(`SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext(DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2)`,
Windows 10 1703+) before any DPI-sensitive Win32 call, and fails loud (never
falls back to the DPI-broken legacy call) if the Windows build refuses it -
this bundle's own no-silent-degradation rule (a capture that cannot
faithfully represent a monitor must fail loud, not return a misleading
frame).
