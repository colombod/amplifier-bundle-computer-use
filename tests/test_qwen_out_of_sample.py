"""OUT-OF-SAMPLE extensibility probe: Qwen (Alibaba DashScope).

`docs/designs/multi-provider-design.md` Sec 18 states the extensibility claim and
then disowns the measurement behind it: Gemini was added at a cost of 0 files
outside `providers.py`, but the base had been improved KNOWING Gemini's shape.
Sec 18's own words - "That is fitting the base to the test case... It is not a
measurement" - and it names the missing test: a provider whose shape informed
nothing in the table.

Qwen is that provider. It was investigated and dropped in Phase 0 BEFORE
`providers.py` existed (`tests/fixtures/captures/qwen-verdict.md`), and it
diverges on an axis none of the three incumbents touch: **it has no wire tool
type at all**. Its declaration is a `computer_use` JSON schema pasted into the
SYSTEM PROMPT as text; its action arrives as `<tool_call>...</tool_call>` inside
`message.content` and must be regexed out.

This file is the instrument, not a feature. `providers.QWEN` is deliberately
NOT in `DIALECTS` - the tests below monkeypatch it in where they need it, the
same way `test_provider_dialects.py` already does with synthetic dialects, and
`test_qwen_is_not_in_the_shipped_table` pins that real dispatch is untouched.

VERDICT RECORDED HERE: FALSIFIED. Two of the seven `Dialect` fields cannot hold
Qwen's facts, and one of the two failures is not in the table at all - it is in
the CALL PATH that reaches the table. See the two `test_break_*` tests.
