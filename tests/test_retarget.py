"""Unit tests: `desktop(action="retarget")` (M4 - docs/designs/capability-
awareness.md \u00a76), and the atomic-binding fix a six-lens council named for
its verified race (\u00a76.3/\u00a710.4).

What this file proves:

1. The verified race is real (a naive, field-by-field swap - "self._backend
   = new" then, separately, "self._announced = False" - lets a concurrent
   unlocked reader observe a torn mix), and `ComputerTool.retarget()`'s
   single atomic `_Binding` reference swap closes it: hammering
   `retarget()` against a concurrent action never produces that mix.
2. Nothing built during a failed retarget leaks: the half-built new
   backend is always released, and the current binding is left exactly as
   it was.
3. The NEW target gets its own real disclosure before the swap - never
   reuses the OLD target's `announced` state.
4. A refusal (human present, disclosure declined) blocks the retarget and
   leaves the current binding untouched.

No real backend, no real display server, no real SSH - matching every
other test file in this suite. Every backend name/host used below is
unique per test (`_unique()`) because `_channel_ledgers`/
`_channel_band_state`/`_announcement_decisions` are module-level, process-
wide caches that persist across tests in the same run.

# -- 6. The policy-bypass race (a six-lens council's worse finding) ---------
#
# The atomic `_Binding` swap above (tests 1a/1b) closes the DISCLOSURE race
# the review originally verified. A later review reproduced a DIFFERENT,
# worse race against unmodified production code: a MUTATING action's
# `read_only` check and its actual backend dispatch used to read
# `self._binding` SEPARATELY (`self._read_only` in `_execute_calls`, then
# `self._backend` inside `_run`, moments later) - a concurrent `retarget()`
# swap could land in between, so a write checked under an OLD, PERMISSIVE
# binding could be dispatched against a NEW, RESTRICTIVE one instead. The
# fix: `_execute_calls`/`DesktopTool._execute_action` now read
# `self._binding` ONCE, before the check, and pass that SAME snapshot into
# `_run` for the dispatch (see `_run`'s own docstring).
#
# This section reconstructs the standalone repro that found it. Nothing in
# production code is patched for the repro itself - only the INTERLEAVING
# is deterministically forced (the same technique test 1b above already
# uses), via a real, concurrent `retarget()` and a real `execute()` call for
# a MUTATING action, both completely unmodified.


def test_read_only_check_and_dispatch_never_straddle_a_retarget_swap(monkeypatch):
    """Reconstructs a six-lens council's repro almost verbatim: mount an OLD
    local backend (read_only=False, permissive), race a real `execute()`
    call for `left_click` against a real `retarget()` to a fake REMOTE
    backend (read_only=True by default - no explicit config, so \u00a76.6's
    "retarget never widens/narrows policy on its own" default applies).

    Before the fix, this reproduced on the FIRST try in the standalone
    script this test is drawn from: the check passed under the OLD,
    permissive binding, but the click actually landed on the NEW,
    restrictive backend - `new_backend.click_calls` was non-empty. Hammered
    here across many iterations (timing-dependent, like every real race in
    this file - see test 1b's own comment) because a single iteration
    provides no guarantee the window was entered.

    The load-bearing assertion: `new_backend.click_calls` must NEVER receive
    an entry, across every iteration - not "usually doesn't", not "rarely
    does" - because `new_backend` is always read_only=True (remote,
    unconfigured) and a write that ever reaches it despite that is exactly
    the policy bypass the council verified. A second assertion (at least one
    iteration actually dispatched to `old_backend`) proves the test isn't
    vacuous - that real interleaving, not just "retarget always finishes
    first" or "click always finishes first", was actually exercised.
